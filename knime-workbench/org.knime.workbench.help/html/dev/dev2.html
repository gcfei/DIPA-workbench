<h2>The first steps on how to create your own node</h2>
<p>If you want to extend the functionality of KNIME you can
implement your own Nodes and contribute them to the KNIME Node
Repository. A node consists of four basic classes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The NodeModel: contains the main algorithm and administrates
	the data flow.</li>
	<li>The NodeDialog (optional): provides the means to configure the
	algorithm of the NodeModel.</li>
	<li>The NodeView (optional): displays information about the result
	of the NodeModel's algorithm.</li>
	<li>The NodeFactory: Bundles all the classes together.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition an XML file is mandatory (with exactly the same name
as the factory). It specifies the name and type of the node, and
describes the node, the configuration options, the in- and output, and
the view(s) of the node.</p>

<p>So that the user does not have to create all files by hand, the
KNIME platform provides a new-node-extension-wizard, which collects
necessary information from the user and automatically creates a KNIME
plugin.</p>

<p>In the KNIME perspective, select File-&gt;New-&gt;Other-&gt;
KNIME-&gt;Create a new KNIME Node-Extension.
Continue by clicking the Next button. In the next screen enter the
details about your node. Let's assume you want to write a numeric binner
that assigns the data into equidistant bins according to the value of a
specific attribute value. We will call that node NumericBinnerNode. Your
new-node-extension-wizard would look similar to the one shown in
Illustration 1:</p>

<p>Enter a project name with which you will find it in the KNIME
workflow navigator. The node class name is the name of your node. The
necessary classes described above all start with this name (e.g.
NumericBinnerNodeModel, NumericBinnerNodeDialog, etc.). In the <q>Package
name</q> field specify the package name of the node. In the <q>Node
vendor</q> field enter your name. Your name appears as the author name in
the java doc. In the <q>Node description text</q> field provide a short
description of your node. Finally specify the node type: this assigns a
specific background color to the node in the KNIME workflow.</p>
<p>After clicking the Finish button the new-node-extension-wizard
creates the project and all necessary directories and files required for
a proper KNIME plugin as depicted in Illustration 2:</p>

<p>If the project contains errors concerning the Java build path try
the following: Select from the menu Projekt-&gt;Clean... Select
&quot;Clean projects selected below&quot; and select the newly created
project or &quot;Clean all projects&quot;. This fixes the errors in most
of the cases.</p>

<p>The created classes contain only exemplary method stubs that can
be completely deleted. You must add the desired functionality. The
following sections explain how to do this step-by-step.</p>
