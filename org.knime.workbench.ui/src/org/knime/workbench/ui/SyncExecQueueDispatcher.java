/**
 * A static class offering functionality that should be used instead of the
 * usual <code>Display.getDefault().asyncExec(Runnable)</code> procedure.
 *
 * <p>
 * The method {@link Display#asyncExec(Runnable) asyncExec} offered by the
 * {@link Display} class has performance problems if requests come in faster
 * than they are processed; reason being the class
 * {@link org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Synchronizer} (specifically the method
 * addLast), which keeps an array of to-be-processed runnables. This array is
 * virtually resized by a fixed size (currently 4) as more runnables come in.
 * There are three expensive operations: a static synchronization, the memory
 * allocation for the new array, and the array copy.
 *
 * <p>This class uses a {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor} to
 * queue runnables (which are then processed using
 * {@link Display#syncExec(Runnable)}.
 *
 * <p>The use of this class fixes bug #1551 (NodeFigure update events block UI),
 * i.e. the update events that are sent by a looping workflow block the UI.
