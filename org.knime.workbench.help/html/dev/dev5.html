<h2>How to save and load your internal representation</h2>
<p>Now try the following: execute the node, save, close and re-open
the workflow. Your node is still executed but when you open the view no
data is available. This is because your internal representation, i.e.
the bins, is not saved automatically. To ensure that your internal
representation can be stored and loaded, the KNIME framework provides
two methods in the NodeModel: loadInternals and saveInternals. The
following explains how to implement these methods for our numeric binner
node.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a ModelContent object. To the ModeContent you can add
	the raw types of Java, such as int, double, String, etc. Also DataCells
	and subconfigs can be stored. Subsequently, the NodeSettings can be
	written to XML with saveToXML and loaded with the static method
	loadFromXML.</li>
	<li>If you have a DataTable, DataArray or similar as your internal
	model you can use the convenient static method: <br />
	<pre>DataContainer.writeToZip(DataTable yourTable, File zipFile);</pre>
	</li>
	<li>If neither of the above-mentioned methods fit you can
	serialize your internal model and write it to file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the serialization of objects is slow and prone to errors,
we use the ModelContent approach to store our internal model. Since a
numeric bin is not a raw type, it cannot be stored directly by
ModelContent. However, each NumericBin consists only of raw types.
Moreover, it is enough to store the contained row IDs, because the
visual representation can be restored from this information: the size of
a drawn bin depends on the width and height of the panel (which is
evaluated in the paint method) and the number of contained rows. We
provide two methods to let each NumericBin save and load itself from the
ModelContent and afterwards store the ModelContents in the main
ModelContent in the NodeModel. First of all each NumericBin must provide
methods to save itself to and load itself from ModelContent:</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * Adds the IDs of the contained rows to the settings. This is sufficient in order 
     * to later on restore the visual representation, since that only depends on
     * the dimension of the panel and the number of contained rows per bin.
     * 
     * @param modelContent the model content object to save to.
     */
    public void saveTo(final ModelContentWO modelContent) {
        DataCell[] cellArray = new DataCell[m_containedRowIds.size()]; 
            m_containedRowIds.toArray(cellArray);
        modelContent.addDataCellArray(CFG_KEY_CELLS, cellArray);
    }

    /**
     * Loads the contained row IDs.
     *  
     * @param modelContent
     * @throws InvalidSettingsException
     */
    public void loadFrom(final ModelContentRO modelContent) 
        throws InvalidSettingsException{
        DataCell[] cellArray = modelContent.getDataCellArray(CFG_KEY_CELLS);
        m_containedRowIds.addAll(Arrays.asList(cellArray));
    }
	</pre>
<p>Again, we need an internal key to identify the stored field - in
this case the CFG_KEY_CELLS. It only has to be unique in this class, as
each object receives its own ModelContent object. Now we can save and
load our bins in the NodeModels saveInternals and loadInternals methods.
In the saveInternals we get the directory to store our files. We create
a new ModelContent object and for each bin we create a sub model content
which is passed to the bin. The bin itself writes the necessary
information in the sub model content. Afterwards we create a new file in
the given directory, create an output stream and let the main model
content write itself to XML.</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * 
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeModel#saveInternals(java.io.File, 
     * org.knime.core.node.ExecutionMonitor)
     */
    protected void saveInternals(final File internDir,
            final ExecutionMonitor exec) throws IOException,
            CanceledExecutionException {
       // create the main model content
       ModelContent modelContent = new ModelContent(INTERNAL_MODEL);
       for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_bins.length; i++) {
           // for each bin create a sub model content
           ModelContentWO subContent = modelContent.addModelContent(
                   NUMERIC_BIN + i);
           // save the bin to the sub model content
           m_bins[i].saveTo(subContent);
       }
       // now all bins are stored to the model content
       // but the model content must be written to XML
       // internDir is the directory for this node
       File file = new File(internDir, FILE_NAME);
       FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);
       modelContent.saveToXML(fos);
    }
    </pre>
<p>The loading of the internal model works accordingly. Create the
file and an input stream and let the main model content load from the
XML file. Then fetch the sub model content for every bin and let each
bin load itself from this sub model content. Add the bin to your field.

    protected void loadInternals(final File internDir,
            final ExecutionMonitor exec) throws IOException,
            CanceledExecutionException {
        m_bins = new NumericBin[m_numberOfBins.getIntValue()];
        File file = new File(internDir, FILE_NAME);
        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
        ModelContentRO modelContent = ModelContent.loadFromXML(fis);
        try {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; m_numberOfBins.getIntValue(); i++) {
                NumericBin bin = new NumericBin();
                ModelContentRO subModelContent = modelContent
                        .getModelContent(NUMERIC_BIN + i);
                bin.loadFrom(subModelContent);
                m_bins[i] = bin;
            }
        } catch (InvalidSettingsException e) {
            throw new IOException(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
    </pre>
<p>When you now try again to execute, save, close and re-open the
workflow, you will see, that the view displays the desired information.
